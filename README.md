## Introduction

The Pixel/Image Detector Bot is a versatile tool designed to enhance your gaming experience by allowing you to effortlessly trigger specific actions or keypresses in response to the detection of predefined objects within the game environment. This bot leverages the power of Python, OpenCV, and other libraries to streamline your gaming strategy.

### Main Page

The main page of the Pixel Detector Bot serves as your command center. Here, you can load an image and specify keywords or mouse movements that, when detected within the game, will trigger predefined actions. This feature is especially useful for gamers who want to execute actions promptly without the hassle of manual input, allowing them to stay focused on the game.

### Add Page

The Add Page provides a seamless way to add images for detection. Simply upload an image, and the bot will automatically capture a screenshot of the game environment. You can then crop and select specific areas of interest within the screenshot to track. This flexibility ensures that you can fine-tune the bot to respond to precisely the in-game elements you need.

### Edit Page

Mistakes happen, and the Edit Page is here to help you correct them. If you need to make adjustments to your configured triggers or actions, simply head to the Edit Page. Here, you can edit your details, refine your settings, and ensure that your bot is perfectly aligned with your gaming strategy.

## How It Works

The Pixel/Image Detector Bot relies on a combination of powerful technologies to deliver seamless performance:

- **OpenCV**: We use OpenCV's template matching capabilities to compare the cropped image with the current game screen, enabling precise object detection.

- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: To capture screenshots of the game screen, we employ PIL to seamlessly convert screen captures into NumPy arrays for further processing.

- **Ctypes**: For keypress automation, we utilize the ctypes library. This allows us to send keypress commands at a low level, ensuring compatibility with games that may not detect high-level keypresses through libraries like PyAutoGUI.
